A simple and secure tool for generating Ethereum-compatible (EVM) wallets using BIP39 mnemonics and BIP44 derivation paths. The tool can be used both as a Go module in your applications or as a standalone CLI tool.

## ‚ú® Features

- Generate secure Ethereum wallets with 24-word mnemonic phrases
- Derive Ethereum addresses using BIP44 standard derivation path (m/44'/60'/0'/0/0)
- Export wallet information to encrypted files
- Use as a Go module in your projects or as a standalone CLI tool
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Open source and MIT licensed

## üìã Prerequisites

- Go 1.16 or later (only required if building from source or using as a module)
- Git (for cloning the repository)
- For CLI usage, Go 1.16+ is only needed for installation

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Use as a Go Module

```bash
go get github.com/exorich-lab/EVM-GEN/v1@latest
```

Example usage in your Go code:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"

	"github.com/exorich-lab/EVM-GEN/v1/pkg/evmwallet"
)

func main() {
	// Generate a new wallet
	wallet, err := evmwallet.GenerateWallet()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	// Print wallet information
	fmt.Println("Address:", wallet.Address)
	fmt.Println("Mnemonic:", wallet.Mnemonic)
	
	// Save to file
	filename, err := wallet.SaveToFile()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	fmt.Println("Wallet saved to:", filename)
}
```

### Option 2: Install as a CLI Tool

```bash
# Install the latest version
go install github.com/exorich-lab/EVM-GEN/v1/cmd/evmwallet@latest

# Run the tool
evmwallet
```

### Option 3: Build from Source

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/exorich-lab/EVM-GEN.git
   cd EVM-GEN
   ```

2. Build and install:
   ```bash
   go install ./cmd/evmwallet
   ```

3. Run the tool:
   ```bash
   evmwallet
   ```

## üíª CLI Usage

Generate a new wallet:

```bash
evmwallet
```

This will:
1. Generate a new 24-word mnemonic
2. Derive an Ethereum address and private key
3. Save the details to a timestamped file in the `wallets` directory
4. Display the information in the console

### üìù Example Output

```
Mnemonic: word1 word2 ... word24

Ethereum Address: 0x...
Private Key: 0x...

Wallet information has been saved to wallet_20230702_123456.txt
```

## üîí Security Notes

- **Never share your mnemonic phrase or private key with anyone**
- Always store your mnemonic phrase in a secure location
- The generated wallet information is saved to a file in the current directory - make sure to secure or delete this file appropriately
- For production use, consider using hardware wallets or other more secure key management solutions
